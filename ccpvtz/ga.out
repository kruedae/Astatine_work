 Done running NWChem calculations. 

 NWChem failed for the following basis sets (possibly due to linear dependences): 
 27  8  57 
 Total calculations failed : 3 
 Directly promoted to the next generation : 10 
 Going into the tournament stage : 86 
 Best performing basis in this generation gives the error of  0.6039614 [eV] 
 Individual errors: At =  0.0222887 , At+ =  0.0221496 , At- =  0.0221482 [eV]

 Done running NWChem calculations. 

 NWChem failed for the following basis sets (possibly due to linear dependences): 
 41 
 Total calculations failed : 1 
 Directly promoted to the next generation : 10 
 Going into the tournament stage : 88 
 Best performing basis in this generation gives the error of  0.4211287 [eV]

 Done running NWChem calculations. 

 NWChem failed for the following basis sets (possibly due to linear dependences): 
 86 
 Total calculations failed : 1 
 Directly promoted to the next generation : 10 
 Going into the tournament stage : 88 
 Best performing basis in this generation gives the error of  0.4002871 [eV] 
 Individual errors: At =  0.0148133 , At+ =  0.0147047 , At- =  0.0146135 [eV]

 Done running NWChem calculations. 

 NWChem failed for the following basis sets (possibly due to linear dependences): 
 84 
 Total calculations failed : 1 
 Directly promoted to the next generation : 10 
 Going into the tournament stage : 88 
 Best performing basis in this generation gives the error of  0.1537686 [eV]

 Done running NWChem calculations. 

 NWChem failed for the following basis sets (possibly due to linear dependences): 
 37  26 
 Total calculations failed : 2 
 Directly promoted to the next generation : 11 
 Going into the tournament stage : 86 
 Best performing basis in this generation gives the error of  0.1365529 [eV] 
 Individual errors: At =  0.0051612 , At+ =  0.0050335 , At- =  0.0048602 [eV]
